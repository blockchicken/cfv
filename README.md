Cardfight Vanguard Simulator

'''
Abstract: The game of Cardfight Vanguard is one of hundreds of probabilistic happenstances occurring in quick succession, as creatures fight back and forth until one player emerges victorious. However, no single occurrence is independent of another. Each move dictates all future moves. Predicting success of certain groups of cards, strategies, and even so much as inference from the initial coin-flip are all far too challenging to calculate by hand. Instead, I've devised this system to simulate hundreds of thousands of games in a Monte Carlo style simulation. Let's see what we can learn! And remember to Stand up! the Vanguard!!
